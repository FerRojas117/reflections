How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Because by viewing the difference, you can spot typos or other 
    mistakes that were probably introduced to the newest file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you save time by going back to a state where the code was bug-free
    or you just realized that that was not the way to go, in that case you can recover
    all the past text to a point where things were OK. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: you have the ability to keep changes consistent, and easy to check and review
    cons: possible data loss if a change has not been committed	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because by allowing saving multiple files at once, you make sure that all changes 
    in multiple files that might affect your project, are also saved and 
    of course to keep of the changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives you a track of all commits made to the project, and by using git diff
    you can compare two different commits in time, to check the history of changes
    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    They make me more confident because no I know that if I introduce a new feature
    I will be able that if I make a mistake, I can go back to a state where there was 
    no bugs and fix the newly introduced bug

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    TO CODE
